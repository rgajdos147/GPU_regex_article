GPU Acceleration for Regular Expressions: Revision on Newer Hardware

In my article, I will perform an analysis by synthesizing findings from various studies, with a primary focus on the study titled "GPU Acceleration of Regular Expression Matching for Large Datasets: Exploring the Implementation Space."[1]

I intend to re-evaluate the performance metrics, specifically concerning GPU acceleration of regular expression matching, on a more recent hardware setup to see if there have been any changes or improvements. By doing so, I aim to provide updated insights into the effectiveness of GPU-based regex acceleration.

The article's goal is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of GPU versus CPU performance in regular expression tasks, supported by a synthesis of relevant research and fresh benchmarking on modern hardware.
