Regexes are commonly used for text pro-
cessing and input sanitization [105], appearing, for example, in an
estimated 30-40% of open-source Python projects

% The process of taking data or
information from sites on the internet is called web scraping.
The results
of the experiment show that web scraping with the regex
method is the smallest in memory usage compared to the
HTML DOM method, and Xpath

By contrast, databases do not operate on a fixed set of regular expressions. Instead, expressions change frequently, e.g., with each query. Another difference is that on a given data input, only a single or a few regular expressions are evaluated rather than hundreds. Finally, the notion of line-rate is different as the solution needs to match or come close to the memory speed instead of network rates.
